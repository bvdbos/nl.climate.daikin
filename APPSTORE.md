# Daikin AI
Adds to Homey support for Daikin Air Conditioners and Heatpumps (aka inverters).

## Features
- supports Daikin airconditioners & heatpumps through either a generic driver (I called Inverter) or a model (range) specific one like Emura.
- the airco's Target temperature as well as its operating mode can be controlled from a mobile card.
- mobile card shows target temperature, operating mode, fan rate and fan swing mode.

- 23 flowcards: 9 trigger cards, 9 condition cards and 5 action cards.

### Demo mode (upon pairing the demo mode is by default turned ON !!)
Demo mode can be disabled in the device its settings menu. Demo mode can be very usefull when you are designing new flows as demo mode prevents the airco to be switched on so you can safely experiment and test your new flows (tip... turn on a lamp to verify your flow iso the airco...).

## Change log

## Limitations
HomeKit is not supported. However in future updates I might add a "HomeKit model", that model would than enable one to control just the basic capabilities of "every" WiFi capable Daikin airconditioner using HomeKit.
