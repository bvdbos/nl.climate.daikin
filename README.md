Do not use the MASTER branch for now, what is available in the development branch is the best available.

# Daikin AC
Adds support for Daikin Airconditioners.

# Current useability status:
* "USELESS": app only shows some basic sensor info like in/outside temperature, target temperature, airco mode, fan rate and wing mode.

# To-do (in random order)
* make it possible to change settings
* add flow cards
* improve and extend "error handling"
* differentiate capabilities by model

# THIS APP IS IN DEVELOPMENT
* 31-JAN-18: inside / outside / target temperature (fixed value for now) show on mobile card.
* 02-FEB-18: all data shown on mobile card is read from the airconditioner.
* 03-FEB-18: lifted the requirement to use experimental firmware v1.5.6, can now be previewed with Homey stable firmware v1.5.3.
